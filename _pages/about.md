## Who I am
Hi i'm Daniel, a developer and tinkerer working on DevOps, Machine Learning, Linux tooling. I am based in Singapore 🏝️.

## What I write about
I mostly write on my [Medium](https://medium.com/@danlowgw) account, where I share solutions and breakdown my learnings about larger topics both for my own recollection. 

The articles on medium might require enterprise tools and services (e.g. certain cloud providers or platform providers).

## What to expect here:
In this blog, I'll share articles on my personal workflow/configs to achieve a style of working that works for me. 

As personal configurations are often a matter of taste. They often sit between the lines of form vs function, having somewhere to log these changes over time for me is both meaningful and personal.
