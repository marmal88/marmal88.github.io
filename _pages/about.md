## Who I am
I am Daniel Low, a developer focused on DevOps, Machine Learning, Linux tooling. I am based in the island city of Singapore üèùÔ∏è.

## What I write about
I maintain a [Medium](https://medium.com/@danlowgw) account where I share solutions and breakdown larger topics both for my personal recollection but also as a source of learning for others. The articles here might require tools and services that a regular developer might not have access to for example certain cloud providers or platform providers.

## What to expect here:
Here I will share more opiniated articles on my personal workflow and configs to achieve a style of working that works for me. As configs sometimes sit between the lines of form vs function, having somewhere to log your taste and preferences is both meaningful and a good place to register your thoughts at a given point in time.

## Background and Interests
Outside of development I enjoy learning languages ("French", "Mandarin Chinese" and "Italian") and running.
