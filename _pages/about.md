## Who I am
I am Daniel Low, a developer focused on DevOps, Machine Learning, Linux tooling. I am based in Singapore 🏝️.

## What I write about
I write and share on my [Medium](https://medium.com/@danlowgw) account where I share solutions and breakdown larger topics both for my personal recollection but also as a source of learning for others. 

The articles here might require tools and services that the typical developer might not have access to (e.g. certain cloud providers or platform providers).

## What to expect here:
In this blog I will be sharing more opiniated articles on my personal workflow and configs to achieve a style of working that works for me. 

As personal configurations are often a matter of taste and sit between the lines of form vs function, having somewhere to log these changes over time for me is both meaningful and personal.
