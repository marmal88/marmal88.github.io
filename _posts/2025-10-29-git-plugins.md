So I've recently added 3 new plugins to my git workflow on vim. 

- Gitsigns - for highlighting changes in texts and to offer a view of file changes
- Neogit - for git workflow 
- DiffView - for handling merge changes

Initially I was quite hesitant of installing a new git workflow, as I felt that I didn't want to lose touch of typing the actual git commands in the terminal. 

However, I realized that there were a whole bunch of git commands that I would not have bothered to do if i was not using neogit. 

For example, being able to commit just the lines that I want instead of commiting the entire file is now easily done by selecting the lines and hitting `s`.

Another bug bear was not being able to preview the changes in git stash easily. Now with the inbuilt previewer I can quickly view stashed changes and make a decision on which stash I would like to keep.
