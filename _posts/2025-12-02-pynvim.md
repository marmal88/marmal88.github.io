## 1. Python files
An issue that I experienced when configuring neovim was this long waiting time when opening python files.

After some searching I realized that neovim didn't know which python version I was using, and thus had to search through the `$PATH` to find the right python provider.

To fix this issue I had to sync the python manager that I was using with neovim. 

### 1.1 How to debug
To debug this issue run the command `nvim --startuptime nvim_startup.log init.py`.

The above command commands neovim to write the output of it's startup calls into a file called `nvim_startup.log`.

By examining the log specifically around the `init.py` file, one can see that it takes a long time for the file to load.

You can confirm this by running the `:checkhealth provider` command in neovim, which should show that the python provider is missing.

## 1.2 The fix!
The python manager that I was using was `uv` and thus to I had to run the command `uv tool install --upgrade pynvim`. 

If you are using any other dependency provider you can follow their documentation [here](https://github.com/neovim/pynvim)

Once completed you can use the command `:checkhealth provider` in neovim to return the status of the configured.
