# Blog maintainence


## Getting started 
We are using the remote theme method for installing the packages [link](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/#remote-theme-method)

1. To upgrade the gems run the command `bundle` after updating Gemfile
2. To serve the website locally run the command `bundle exec jekyll serve`.
